    <h2>A Week of Banquets</h2>

    <p>I love a good banquet, especially one I don't have to pay for. This week alone I am required to attend to. I'm excited for one because I get to wear one of the new dresses that I bought, but the other took that fun away because I have to wear a suit (once again). The food should be good, and it's a chance for me to see some of these these students act like they've got some sense because parents will be in town.</p>

        <p>This is my first post on this website, and it's stressing me out because I can't figure out how to get my about me page to show up... this shouldn't be so difficult.

            <h2>The Ides of March</h2>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span>Post by Celeste, May 2,2018.</h5>
            <h5><span class="label label-danger">March</span> <span class="label label-primary">posts</span></h5><br>
            <p>March of 2018 has been hell. Between falling behind in school and work, showing up right in the middle of midterms, and having to stay up to date in classes, I've barely slept and I'm still majorly behind. This month has been a toss up of good and bad days, and I'm honestly <em>beyond</em> excited that it's almost over.</p>
